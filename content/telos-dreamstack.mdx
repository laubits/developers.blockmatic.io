The TELOS DreamStack Project provides set of principles, guidelines, tools, packages and starters to jumpstart and speed up dApp development following best practices for security, performance and maintainability of your application.

Application performance is a critical factor in the success of a project, and a major indicator of software quality. It is even one of the essential criteria that determine user satisfaction.

Software maintainability is defined as the degree to which an application is understood, repaired, or enhanced; Developers spent most of their time understing other people's code, and that  is not a trivial endeavor; therefore, it is important to adhere to clear conventions so that the next developer has as little overhead as possible when reading your code.

TELOS Dreamstack follows Blockmatic's code style convention that aims to maximize reusability and facilitate collaboration. We have chosen the stack carefully so that it allows us to write robust and performant ReactJS and React Native applications with more concise and readable code.

## Techonologies

### GraphQL

### Postgres

### Hasura

### Apollo Federation

### React and React Native

React have become the defacto standard although others like vue and angular offer similar functionalities ReactJS functional approach, composability and performace are still unmatched.
...

### System UI

System UI is an open source organization that houses a [Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme) for creating interoperable UI components. It is also the home for the Theme UI and DesignQL libraries that are built upon the foundation of this specification. The intent behind this specification is to help make UI components, libraries, and tools as interoperable as possible.

The theme object is intended to be a general purpose format for storing design system style values, scales, and/or design tokens. The object itself is not coupled to any particular library's implementation and can be used in places where sharing common style values in multiple parts of a code base is desirable.
