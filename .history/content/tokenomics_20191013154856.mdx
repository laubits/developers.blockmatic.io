Token models are akin to Business models. Business Models define how a business creates value for a customer base whilst capturing value via profits for its shareholders. Token models are different in the sense that we are trying to drive value into the token oppose to extracting value via profit. I like to use William Mougayarâ€™s definition of a token to help explain what a token is.

> A unit of value that an organization creates to self-govern its business model, and empower its users to interact with its products while facilitating the distribution and sharing of rewards and benefits to all of its stakeholders

Token models have the ability to transform business models and create an ecosystem which encourages value creation over value extraction and this has been the underlying principle in the emanate ecosystem. To reward the value creators.
