We want to follow a common code style convention across all projects to maximize reusability and facilitate collaboration. We have chosen carefully so that it allows us to write robust, secure and performant applications with more concise and readable code.

## Code style

- Functional JavaScript.
- React Hooks.
- Separate by Concern.
- Descriptive Naming.
- Declarative Programming.
- Avoid Hasty Abstractions.
- Isolated Component State.
- Self-documenting. Clean Code.
- No semis, no var, use const.
- Component Error Boundaries.
