## AWS Accounts

We have an AWS organization with multiple accounts.

- `master account` owns the organization and have access to consolidated billing.
- `playground account` is dedicated to experimentation and everyone has admin rights here.
- `development account` holds the `dev` and `stg` VPCs, and other feature environments.
- `production account` highly secured, holds a zero trust `prod` VPC.
- `monitoring account` is used event log aggregation. Engineering have restricted access for debugging.
