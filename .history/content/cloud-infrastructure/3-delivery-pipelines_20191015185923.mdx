Hey Guys, on the Emanate.live we have SRR through jamiebuilds/react-loadable running on Virtual Machine.

This means that like Netlify won't work for this application. In order to have a continuous delivery, deployment and ephemeral testing environments per branch and pull request we would need first: use containers for convenience  and create the build pipelines and setup CI server that pushes the containers to something like AWS Fargate. Then we would need a clean up process, etc...  involves time to setup and maintain.

I think the quicker way to get that functionality would be to use https://zeit.co, we just need to define the dockerfile and build enviroments , and everything else is provided. It's one of simpler and more efficient ways to deploys docker based services. https://zeit.co/docs/v2/advanced/now-for-github/

For backend services we probably want manage entirely and test services in an environment as identical to production, just with less resources, no redundancy, etc.

I've setup a backend staging with ephemeral clients per Pull Request and it def better that no having the ephemeral react client instances, as it allows to show and test UI quickly.  API updates become a bit more cumbersome but in small team it is ok.

So this setup could be the first step towards automated deployments.   Staging APIs and ephemeral react clients on the fly on Zeith.

Then we could move the APIs to docker automated the deployment to AWS Fargate

Really impressive how simpler seems to be to setting up the delivery pipelines.
The free tier is  generous https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/
We should def consider this software for our delivery pipelines
