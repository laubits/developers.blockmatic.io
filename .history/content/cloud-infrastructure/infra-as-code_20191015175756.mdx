### Speed and Simplicity

IaC allows you to spin up an entire infrastructure architecture by running a script.

Not only can you deploy virtual servers, but you can also launch pre-configured databases, network infrastructure, storage systems, load balancers, and any other cloud service that you may need.

You can do this quickly and easily for development, staging, and production environments, which can make your software development process much more efficient (more about this later).

Also, you can easily deploy standard infrastructure environments in other regions where your cloud provider operates so they can be used for backup and disaster recovery.

You can do all this by writing and running code.

### Configuration Consistency
Standard operating procedures can help maintain some consistency in the infrastructure deployment process. But human error will always rear its ugly head, which may leave you with subtle differences in configurations that may be difficult to debug.

IaC completely standardizes the setup of infrastructure so there is reduced possibility of any errors or deviations. This will decrease the chances of any incompatibility issues with your infrastructure and help your applications run more smoothly.

### Minimization of Risk
Imagine having a lead engineer be the only one who knows the ins and outs of your infrastructure setup. Now imagine that engineer leaving your company.

What would you do then? There’d be a bunch of questions, some fear and panic, and many attempts at reverse engineering.

Not only does IaC automate the process, but it also serves as a form of documentation of the proper way to instantiate infrastructure and insurance in the case where employees leave your company with institutional knowledge.

Configurations are bound to change to accommodate new features, additional integrations, and other edits to the application’s source code. If an engineer edits the deployment protocol, it can be difficult to pin down exactly what adjustments were made and who was responsible.

Because code can be version-controlled, IaC allows every change to your server configuration to be documented, logged, and tracked. And these configurations can be tested, just like code.

So if there is an issue with the new setup configuration, it can be pinpointed and corrected much more easily, minimizing risk of issues or failure.

### Increased Efficiency in Software Development

Developer productivity drastically increases with the use of IaC. Cloud architectures can be easily deployed in multiple stages to make the software development life cycle much more efficient.

Developers can launch their own sandbox environments to develop in. QA can have a copy of production that they can thoroughly test. Security and user acceptance testing can occur in separate staging environments. And then the application code and infrastructure can be deployed to production in one move.

Infrastructure as Code allows your company to use Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment techniques while minimizing the introduction of human errors after the development stage.

You can also include in your IaC script the spinning down of environments when they’re not in use. This will shut down all the resources that your script created, so you won’t end up with a bunch of orphan cloud components that everyone is too afraid to delete. This will further increase the productivity of your engineering staff by having a clean and organized cloud account.

### Cost Savings
Automating the infrastructure deployment process allows engineers to spend less time performing manual work, and more time executing higher-value tasks. Because of this increased productivity, your company can save money on hiring costs and engineers’ salaries.

As mentioned earlier, your IaC script can automatically spin down environments when they’re not in use, which will further save on cloud computing costs.

## Immutable Infrastructure
In a traditional mutable server infrastructure, servers are continually updated and modified in place. Engineers and administrators working with this kind of infrastructure can SSH into their servers, upgrade or downgrade packages manually, tweak configuration files on a server-by-server basis, and deploy new code directly onto existing servers. In other words, these servers are mutable; they can be changed after they're created. Infrastructure comprised of mutable servers can itself be called mutable, traditional, or (disparagingly) artisanal.

An immutable infrastructure is another infrastructure paradigm in which servers are never modified after they're deployed. If something needs to be updated, fixed, or modified in any way, new servers built from a common image with the appropriate changes are provisioned to replace the old ones. After they're validated, they're put into use and the old ones are decommissioned.

The benefits of an immutable infrastructure include more consistency and reliability in your infrastructure and a simpler, more predictable deployment process. It mitigates or entirely prevents issues that are common in mutable infrastructures, like configuration drift and snowflake servers. However, using it efficiently often includes comprehensive deployment automation, fast server provisioning in a cloud computing environment, and solutions for handling stateful or ephemeral data like logs.

## Technology for Deploying Infrastructure as Code

### Terraform

Terraform is the configuration orchestration tool that works with any cloud, be it private on-prem or public system, and allows safe and convenient design, management and improvement for infrastructure as code.
You can define your entire infrastructure—servers, databases, load balancers, network topology, and so on—in Terraform configuration files and commit those files to version control. You then run certain Terraform commands, such as terraform apply, to deploy that infrastructure. The terraform binary parses your code, translates it into a series of API calls to the cloud providers specified in the code, and makes those API calls as efficiently as possible on your behalf.
When someone on your team needs to make changes to the infrastructure, instead of updating the infrastructure manually and directly on the servers, they make their changes in the Terraform configuration files, validate those changes through automated tests and code reviews, commit the updated code to version control, and then run the terraform apply command to have Terraform make the necessary API calls to deploy the changes.

### Containers
The primary benefits of containers are efficiency and agility. Containers are orders of magnitude faster to provision, and much lighter-weight to build and define versus methods like omnibus software builds and full Virtual Machine images. Containers in a single OS are also more efficient at resource utilization than running a Hypervisor and guest OSS.

Efficiency and agility are good for everyone, but they become game-changers at scale.

Containers offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run. This decoupling allows container-based applications to be deployed easily and consistently, regardless of whether the target environment is a private data center, the public cloud, or even a developer’s personal laptop. Containerization provides a clean separation of concerns, as developers focus on their application logic and dependencies, while IT operations teams can focus on deployment and management without bothering with application details such as specific software versions and configurations specific to the app.

For those coming from virtualized environments, containers are often compared with virtual machines (VMs). You might already be familiar with VMs: a guest operating system such as Linux or Windows runs on top of a host operating system with virtualized access to the underlying hardware. Like virtual machines, containers allow you to package your application together with libraries and other dependencies, providing isolated environments for running your software services. As you’ll see below however, the similarities end here as containers offer a far more lightweight unit for developers and IT Ops teams to work with, carrying a myriad of benefits.

## Continuous Deployment and Monitoring
The one thing that all continuous deployment methods do have in common is the need for a strong monitoring solution. Developers are always under tight deadlines. In an ever-evolving environment, agility is essential to keeping pace.  Software teams all over the world are expected to move faster, test earlier, and release more frequently, all while improving quality and reducing costs.  The business wants their new functionality and their bug fixes right now. However, for teams taking an agile approach or hoping to adopt a DevOps culture in their organization, it’s vital to recognize that proactively monitoring of production is an essential element in achieving these goals.
In future phases of development continuous security and availability monitoring processes will be configured to ensure system health, automatically detect and take actions on intrusion attempts detection or availability problems. Infrastructure as Code allows to program detection of misconfigurations of unexpected behavior and take actions to return do desired state.
