Emanate's Cloud Infrastructure is entirely managed as code following devops best practices for continuous integration, delivery and deployment. We leverage tools such Terraform (with Terragrunt), Docker and Ansible to provision it. The majority of Emanate's infrastructure sits on AWS at the moment.
