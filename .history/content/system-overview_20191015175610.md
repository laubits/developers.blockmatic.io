Emanate.live is as ReactJS based web application that provides collaboration features for music creators and the listening experience for consumers. This web client communicates through http RPC APIs and websockets with public EOS nodes and the Emanate backend services on the AWS cloud. The landing page content is managed by a Strapi CMS instance and consumed using GraphQL.

All Emanate cloud infrastructure lives on a Virtual Private Cloud in AWS, leveraging Zero-Trust Networks and Beyond Corp security best practices.

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the approach to defining computing and network infrastructure through source code that can then be treated just like any software system. Such code can be kept in source control to allow auditability and reproducible builds, subject to testing practices, and the full discipline of continuous delivery.
