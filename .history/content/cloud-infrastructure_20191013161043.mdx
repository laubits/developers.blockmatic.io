All Emanate cloud infrastructure lives on a Virtual Private Cloud in AWS, leveraging Zero-Trust Networks and Beyond Corp security best practices.

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the approach to defining computing and network infrastructure through source code that can then be treated just like any software system. Such code can be kept in source control to allow auditability and reproducible builds, subject to testing practices, and the full discipline of continuous delivery.
